# Custom Fonts

The Reddit Sans fonts in this directory are Copyright
[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) and or
[Stephen Hutchings](https://www.s-ings.com/) (who is listed as the font creator
in the font metadata).

They're distributed by Reddit for use in Reddit Avatar graphics:

- https://www.redditstatic.com/crypto-assets/v2/-core-styles-fonts-redditsans-redditsans-extrabold-5d96a4e524.woff2

The fonts are included here, only for the same Reddit Avatar graphics use-case

Note that the versions here have been converted to woff (v1) from woff2, but are
otherwise identical.
